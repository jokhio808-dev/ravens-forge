# Odin as the Existential Rebel

Odin pays for sight with himself. He steps into the unknown, trades comfort for clarity, and accepts the cost. That is rebellion—not against the world, but against unearned certainty.

- Practice: Give up one comforting illusion this week.
- Question: What truth would you pay to see?
- Tool: A small notebook. Name a price, then take the first step.

“Whoever fights monsters should see to it that he does not become a monster.” — Nietzsche
